## Points to remember while testing the app

1. First setup the backend by following instructions in this [repository](https://github.com/prathamesh-mutkure/anti-cheat-app-backend)
2. When testing on android emulator, if you get a connection error use `http://10.0.2.2/` instead of `localhost`
3. iOS emulator doesn't support camera, this will give an error, use a real device to test AI features.
4. On real devices, make sure your PC and mobile are connected to same network, use network IP address instead of `localhost`
5. Don't forgot the `PORT` number
6. Allow **permissions** for camera and mic when asked
7. Make sure the `BACKEND_URL` is appended with `/api`
